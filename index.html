      <h2> What are Pickles? </h2>
      <p>
        Pickles are pickled cucumbers that have been pickled in brine, vinegar, or other solution that has been left to ferment for a period of time. They were first created in Mesopotamia when Mesopotamians would soak cucumbers in an acidic brin in order to preserve them. Over the years, pickles have been a staple in many cultures. Did you know that pickles were first brought to America by Christopher Columbus? Many sailors loved to have pickles aboard their ship as they could survive long journets and even prevented scurvy. If you go to buy pickles in a grocery store, you will see that there are more than one type. One type of pickle is the kosher dill. These pickels are tangy and are soaked in a vinegary brine with seasoning (like coriander seeds) and dill. Another type is the half sour which are crisp and fermented in a seasoned brine without vinegar. The history of pickles is almost as rich as the pickle itself!

      <h2> How are Pickles Consumed Around the World? </h2>
      <p> 
        Pickles are loved all around the world so it shouldn't be a surprise that people have found different ways to enjoy it. In America, pickles are normally eaten as a snack. For a cold and crunchy snack, you can eat them straight out of the jar. Just taking a fork to the pickle or cutting up the pickle into bite-sized pieces are all excellent ways to enjoy a pickle. Personally, I prefer the fork method. A popular pickled dish in Korea is kimchi. Kimchi, fermented vegetables, is the national dish and eaten with very meal. Traditionally, Koreans eat kimchi by itself but it can also be seen as a burger topping or in fried rice. In India, people like to prepare their own pickles. The best-known Indian pickles are mango and lime achars. In fact, almost anything can be made into achar (a South Asian pickle native to India), including meat and seafood. Achar is prepared with rich spices. For instance, in north India the pickles are prepared with mustard oil, ginger and garlic, mando powder, chilis, cumin, etc. Meanwhile, in south Indian, many pickles are prepared with lim, curshed chilli, and coriander. If you are an advent pickle lover, I reccomend trying pickles from all around the world.

      <h2> Do Pickles have any Health Benefits? </h2>
      <p>
          Like most vegetables, pickles are almost all water and have very little fat or protein. They also have a high concentraition of vitamins because the salty brine draws out the water from the pickles. In addition to being a great staple food, pickles have health benefits as well. They can help in digestions as fermented pickles are full of good bacteria called probiotics, which are important for gut health. Pickles also have the ability to ease muscle cramps. Some athletes swear by pickle juice after exercise to quickly replace lost electrolytes. PIckles can also curb sugar spikes. Pickle juice, specifically the vinegar in it, may help keep your blood sugar levels even which can benefit those at risk for diabetes. Although pickles can be good for you, you shouldn't consume too many a day. This is because pickles are brimming with salt. Too much salt in your diet can raise your blood pressure, which increases your chances for a heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. Even though pickles are tasty, you shouldn't eat too many of them because too much of a good thing isn't necessarily good.
